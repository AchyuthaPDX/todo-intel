# todo-intel

This repo has two main files in the frontend file (Sorry for the confusion in naming) which handles both frontend and backend of the project. 
todo-app in the frontend is the main front-end handler written in React JS and backend with Express Node js. 

The database for this project is setup on AWS Cloud with MongoDB Atlas services. The system auto connects to the database as the custom URL is pre-built. 

Working on adding the Timestamps and Serach components.

You can Create tasks, view them, modify them once the task is completed and delete them as well. 

Check the work-dir file to get more info and some screenshots of the project.
